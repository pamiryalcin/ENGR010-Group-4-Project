    "## Vehicle Dynamics Analysis Project\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "In this group project, you will develop a Python-based application to analyze vehicle performance data and simulate basic vehicle dynamics. Your team will create an interactive dashboard that mechanical engineers could use to evaluate vehicle performance metrics, analyze efficiency, and visualize motion characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "One important part of this project is the use of Generative AI tools like ChatGPT to complete the assignment. AI tools are going to become increasingly useful and more widely used in the job market you're headed into, and we want you to be prepared for it.  So, while you need to understand everything the AI creates on your behalf, for this assignment we are not only allowing you to use AI, we are requiring that you make use of it.  Let's see what amazing work you can create when you use AI as your personal assistant.\n",
